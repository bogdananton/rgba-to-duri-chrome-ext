##### RGBA to datauri Chrome Extension

A basic Chrome Extension that generates datauri on the fly using a RGBA input.

Contains the [bant.colorpicker Shadow DOM component](https://github.com/bogdananton/html5-experiments).
The 1x1 px image below the textarea can be saved to disk.

_Not sure if it's of any use, but it was fun remembering about IE :)_
